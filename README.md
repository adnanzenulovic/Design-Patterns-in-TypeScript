## Singleton

```
A singleton is an object that can only be instantiated once. 
It is useful fo implementing a global object that can be accessed from anywhere in the application.
```

## Factory

```
The Factory pattern is a design pattern that provides a way to create objects without 
directly calling their constructors, instead utilizing a factory method or class to 
instantiate objects. This pattern simplifies object creation, allowing for more flexibility,
modular code, and easier maintenance or extension.
