# Design Patterns in TypeScript

## Singleton

```
A singleton is an object that can only be instantiated once. 
It is useful fo implementing a global object that can be accessed from anywhere in the application.
```

## Factory

```
The Factory pattern is a design pattern that provides a way to create objects without 
directly calling their constructors, instead utilizing a factory method or class to 
instantiate objects. This pattern simplifies object creation, allowing for more flexibility,
modular code, and easier maintenance or extension.
```

## Builder

```
The builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex
objects step by step. This pattern is particularly useful when there are many optional parameters 
or when the object creation process requires multiple steps.
```

## Prototype

```
Prototype allows objects to be clones of other objects, rather then extended via inheritance.
This pattern is useful when object creation is expensive, and you want to avoid 
the cost by reusing and modifying existing instances.
```
